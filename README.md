# Rocketchip Tests

This repository contains the project yaml files and scripts required to run the different experiments outlined in the original Rocketchip manuscript. Each subdirectory contains explicit instructions and should be run in the directories as they are organized here. 

In order to replicate these tests, please install and set up [Rocketchip](https://github.com/vhaghani26/rocketchip) first. The figures were generated using a different Conda environment (`figure_env.yml`) than the actual Rocketchip environment.

Feel free to contact me at [vhaghani@ucdavis.edu](vhaghani@ucdavis.edu) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
