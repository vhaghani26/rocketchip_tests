# Rocketchip Tests

This repository contains the project yaml files required to run the different experiments outlined in the original Rocketchip manuscript. It contains explicit instructions and should be run in the directories as they are organized above. 

In order to replicate these tests, please install and set up [Rocketchip](https://github.com/vhaghani26/rocketchip) first.

Feel free to contact me at [vhaghani@ucdavis.edu](vhaghani@ucdavis.edu) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
